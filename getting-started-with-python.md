### Step 2: Write Your First Python Program

Open a new file in your text editor, and write the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file as `hello.py`. Now you can run that file all by yourself because you're a big boy!

### Step 4: Write a Basic Function

Let's write a function that adds two numbers. Add the following code to your `hello.py` file:

```python
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

print(add_numbers(3, 5))
```

## This is renaming

This is another section that contains text. This is something else. This is a change that I am proposing.  Here's a change again.

This is an addition, while this is a change. This section needs to be written.

### Step 5: Run Your Updated Python Program

Run the `hello.py` file again with the command `python hello.py`. You should see the result of the addition printed to the console.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, you've learned more about python and are now ready to do more things with python because you learned.
